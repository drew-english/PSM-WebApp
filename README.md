Public repository for display of class project: Power System Model Web App.

## Details
* The project is still a work in progress.
* All code shown has been created by myself (Drew English) during the course of one college semester.
* The goal of the project is to give users the ability to graphically create power system models, giving clients a simple and intuitive replacement for the text interface they are currently using.
